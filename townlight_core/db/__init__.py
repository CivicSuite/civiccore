"""
Shared SQLAlchemy declarative base for all townlight_core ORM models.

All ORM models in townlight_core (and downstream consumers such as civicrecords-ai)
should inherit from this ``Base`` class so that metadata is shared across the
same declarative registry.  In Phase 2 Step 5, civicrecords-ai will migrate its
own models to import and inherit from this Base rather than maintaining a
separate one.
